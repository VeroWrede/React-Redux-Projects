          Yes, studying is more important. Dancing will be a hobby. Geneva is one the best places to study anything related to politics after all. My aunt is a diplomat here and she has me seriously considering a political career.
          Though it really seems to be about a bunch of selfish weirdos and sweet talkers. Just look at whats going on in the world! It's certainly a field  that requires patience and tact, a challenging position for my straight forward personality.
          During my studies I quickly picked up Japanese, my 5th language so far. Iâ€™d also love to learn Portuguese, so maybe Languages is more my thing? I could become a translator and interpreter at political conferences.
